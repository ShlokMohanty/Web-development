not defining the variables would get assigned to the global object.unless we were in the strict mode 
then we got error if the variables were undefined .
ways of defining variables: const, let, var
var: outside of a function , belongs to the global scope 
var: inside of a function , belongs to that function 
var: inside of a block , for loop , the variable is still available outside of this block .
var has a function scope , not a block scope .
let is the block scoped version of teh var , and is limited to the block(or expression) where it is defined
lat has a block scope 
const is a variable that once it has created , its value can never change .
const has a block scope .
value cannot be changed in the block scope
